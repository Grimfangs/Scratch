## Crappy Bird

### Instructions:
This is a simple game where you are a pigeon and like all pigeons, your objectives in life are to survive and poop on humans.

Use the arrow keys to move and dodge humans and other birds. Crows are simple and mind their own business. They don't bother about you till you get in their way. Red birds are just plain angry and don't want to see you so they tackle you head-on when they can. Eagles are just doing their jobs and trying to kill you form above.

Humans are minding their own business, but since you're a bird, your job is to poop on them for bonus points. Use the space button to poop.

There are three unlockable awards in this game:
Thug Life Award: Score 500 points.
Most Wanted Award: Score 1000 points.
The Messiah Award: Score 2000 points.

And that is all that there is to this game. Survive for as long as you can and poop on as many humans as you can.
